## Wanjuan-CC

Wanjuan-CC(‰∏áÂç∑-CC) is a high-quality English web text dataset efficiently extracted from CommonCrawl, consisting of 1.0T tokens. The results show that compared with various open-source English CC corpora evaluated on different dimensions of the Perspective API, WanJuan-CC exhibits higher safety. Moreover, its practicality is demonstrated through perplexity (PPL) on four validation sets and accuracy on six downstream tasks. WanJuan-CC shows competitive PPL performance on various validation sets, especially on sets like tiny-storys that require higher language fluency. By comparing with similar datasets in 1B model training, using the perplexity of the validation dataset and the accuracy of downstream tasks as evaluation indicators, it has been experimentally proven that WanJuan-CC significantly improves the performance of English text completion and general English ability tasks.

## Data Processing Method

### Brief Description of the Process

In the preparation phase of the WanJuan-CC dataset, the OpenDataLab team built a high-performance distributed data processing framework for data processing. The specific data processing flow is shown in the figure:

<p align="center">

</b>
</p>

1. Extract text from the WARC format data of Common Crawl to obtain "Raw data".
2. Filter the raw data through heuristic rules to generate "Clean data".
3. Process the clean data using an LSH-based deduplication method to get "Dedup data".
4. Filter the dedup data using a filtering method based on keyword and domain lists, as well as a harmful content classifier and obscene content classifier based on Bert, to produce "Safe data".
5. Further filter the safe data using a Bert-based ad classifier and fluency classifier to get "High-Quality data".

### Data Retention Rate at Each Step

We have counted the number of documents at each step and plotted the relative removal rate and absolute retention rate of each data processing step, as shown in the figure:

### Data Example

```json
{
    "id": "Bk3aTI85qrqB0ZWjQ26l",
    "content": "This year I have been overwhelmed by moving house. The planning and organising has dominated my life: packing and unpacking boxes, trying to keep the family fed and watered, being there 100% for my children to settle in. My life - my aims and goals - have taken second place to the family chaos.\nYesterday, for the first time in ages, I sat down and thought: I want to write my book. I want to get this back into my time schedule. I want to make this space for me, for expressing myself, for being creative.\nSo what happens as of 3.15pm tomorrow? School holidays. Am I really likely to get a moment's peace?\nNow I'm planning: take the laptop on holiday. Work out how to blog from mobile (have to confess this is highly unlikely to work!) Consider booking children into holiday camps for entire 5 weeks. (Would Grannie like them?) Insist on a couple of hours a day, uninterrupted, simply to write.\nOr ... accept the reality. Enjoy the children while they are still prepared to tolerate me. Plan for a solid routine when term starts in September.\nWhich do you think will win?",
